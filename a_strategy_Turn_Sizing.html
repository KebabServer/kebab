        <h1>Bet Sizing</h1>
    
        <h2>Simplifying Turn Sizing</h2>
        <p>On the Turn it is sensible to limit your bet-sizing options to either one or two in order to make the game
            tree more manageable.</p>
        <p>In position we will always be simplifying to just one bet size which will either be B75 or B150.</p>
        <p>The idea is that since checking is so profitable in position (sinze we have guaranteed equity realisation for
            at least one street) it is usually not necessary to reopen the action for a smaller bet.</p>
        <p>Out of position we will generally want to have a B33 and either B75 or a B150.</p>
        <p>Which of the larger sizes we choose to include in our strategy will depend on Clarke's Theorem and the extent
            of our nut advantage.</p>
        <p>Because checking has lower EV out of position than it does in position, the smaller bet can often be a
            necessary action.</p>
        <h2>
            <div class="BX" bet_size="B0"></div>
            <div class="BX" bet_size="Check"></div>
        </h2>
        <p>This option is nearly always included on the turn apart for some extremely favourable and rare we continue to
            range bet.</p>
        <h3 class="example">Example: Range bet turn barrel</h3>
        <p>One such spot is: SB vs BU 3BP - Turn C-Bet on: <svg class="svg_hand"
                card-array="3,3,8,s,48,3,8,d,93,3,4,c,155,3,K,h" width="200" height="65">
            </svg></p>
        <p>Betting frequency is governed by favourability.</p>
        <p>In this spot:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>SB's pre-flop range was much richer in Kx.</li>
            <li>BU has folded a lot of his own Kx to the flop CBet, especially if it was a large one.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>
            <div class="B33" bet_size="B33"></div>
        </h2>

        <p> B33 exists on the turn when there is thin value/protection up for grabs. It's much more common OOP than IP
            because check is a much worse alternative from OOP - (Think equity realisation and open/closed action)
        <p> We include B33 as an option in our turn strategy when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Case (A) <span class="yellow">Turn Barrel OOP</span> - In this case we want to block with some Tier 3
                hands that would opt to check if they were in position.</li>
            <li>Case (B) <span class="yellow">Delayed C-Bet Opportunity OOP</span> - We have capped our range on the
                flop and might use mostly B33
                in
                many of these spots.</li>
            <li>Case (C) <span class="yellow">High EV Turn Probe Opportunity Node</span> - We are in a favourable
                situation such as a
                low-coordinated
                board and benefit from thin value and denial with our Tier 3 hands.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> WARNING! Do not include B33 on turn probe opportunities involving higher/less favourable board. As we saw
            last week,
            these spots are played with only: B150 and X</p>
        <h2>
            <div class="B75" bet_size="B75"></div>
        </h2>

        <p>B75 is the go-to replacement for overbetting on turns that repolarise Villain's range. It is also used for
            semi-capped ranges (delayed c-bet spots for example) in position and at SPRs where over-betting is
            unnecessary.</p>
        <p>We include B75 as a turn option in our turn strategy when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Case (A) <span class="yellow">Delayed C-Betting IP</span> with semi-capped range vs semi uncapped range.
                It is not worth blocking (re-opening) here since check is so good IP. We can play B75 or check in most
                cases.</li>
            <li>Case (B) <span class="yellow">Turn Barreling</span> when the card is significantly repolarising for
                Villain's range.</li>
            <li>Case (C) <span class="yellow">Turn Probe</span> - Where IP is too polarised for us to B150.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            <div class="B150" bet_size="B150"></div>
        </h2>
        <p>B150 is the sizing we use to leverage a very big nut advantage and in particular the EV of unique Tier 1
            hands.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Case (A) <span class="yellow">Turn Barreling</span> on depolarising cards.</li>
            <li>Case (B) <span class="yellow">Turn Probe</span> in unfavourable spot - N.A. but no R.A.</li>
            <li>Case (C) <span class="yellow">Delayed C-Bet</span> with Big Relative N.A. - We are bit capped but he is far more capped - Usually OOP (Remember IP we are more capped when we check flop)</li>
        </ul>

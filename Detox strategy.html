<h2> 1.1 - Single Raise IP Aggressor</h2>
<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU: C-bet entire range, 1/3 pot.</li>
<li>Exception vs. SB: Bet top pair+ on double-broadway, middle pair+ on single-broadway, all pairs on low boards (ten-high boards), 1/3 pot. Only bluff with BDFD/BDSD+2 overcards, or BDFD+BDSD+1 overcard. We do not c-bet range vs. SB because the SB range typically flops with much higher equity than the BB range.
Multi-way:</li>
<li>C-bet for value with top pair+, or mid pair+ on low boards (no broadways), 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>C-bet bluff with FD, SD, gutter, or BDFD/BDSD + 2 over-cards, 2/3 pot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU vs. XC-X:</li>
<li>C-bet for value with top pair+ (as long as no 4-card straight/flush completed).</li>
<li>C-bet bluff with gutter+.</li>
<li>X back with middle-low pairs.</li>
<li>X back with weak bluffs except on paired or flush-closing turns, or boards that were paired on the flop. These are hot-spots, bet 2/3 pot with all bluffs.</li>
<li>Vs. XR: Auto-fold bluff catchers. Draws need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis considering implied and direct pot odds.</li>
<li>HU vs. SB X-X: delay stab entire range, 1/2 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. XR-X:</li>
<li>Bet top pair second kicker+. We do not bet-fold top pair to the double-XR all-in when the raise is 6x or less. We fold top pair to any double-XR that is not all-in. (This includes raises from an effective stack of less than 6x. The all-in raise is significantly more merged than the small check raise.)</li>
<li>Check back all other value.</li>
<li>Fire all bluffs, 1/2 pot. Exception: Ace high can be checked.</li>
</ul>


<h3> River </h3>
<ul>
<li>HU vs. XC-XC-X:</li>
<li>No value betting instruction. We need to evaluate on a case by case basis.</li>
<li>This is a hot-spot. Bluff all hands without showdown value from all positions vs. BB, 2/3 pot. You should especially be interested in bluffing connected boards on brick rivers due to the abundance of pair+draw in villains range that will peel turn and fold to river bet. Example: AQ on 984, T, x</li>
<li>Exception vs. SB: Only bluff if the river is a broadway over-card, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. SB X-XC-X: Only bluff if the river is a broadway over-card, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>Vs. XC-XR-X: Never reopen for thin value after calling the turn XR.</li>
<li>HU vs. XC-X-X: This is a hot-spot. Bluff all hands without showdown value, 1/2 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. XR-X-B: Fold without domination.</li>
<li>Vs. XR: Never bluff-catch vs. any opponent profile. We need significant domination over villain's value raising range to justify a call.</li>
<li>Vs. any OOP multi-street aggression (XC-XR-B, XR-B-B): do NOT bluff-catch.</li>
<li>Vs. blocker bet: Never bluff raise.</li>
<li> </li>
<li>Notes:</li>
<li>Play vs. a single limp-caller as you would play vs. the big blind.</li>
<li>We do not have standardized floating requirements vs. the flop check raise because there are too many formation and interactivity nuances to discuss here. This will be taught in more depth in Tier 2 when we introduce the concept of playability.</li>

<ul>
<li>HU vs. X: stab entire range, 1/2 pot.</li>

<li>Multi-way vs. c-bet: increase requirements substantially for weakest calls relative to HU. Gutters+ and midpair + is a good starting instruction.</li>
<li>Multi-way vs. X: bet medium-strength pairs+ and robust draws (gutters+), 1/2 pot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.1 - Single Raise OOP Aggressor</h2>

<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU: X entire range.</li>
<li>Multi-way: Bet top pair+ and gutters+, 2/3 pot. </li>
<li>HU vs. IP stab: apply hot-spot XR strategy with bluffs, XC all pairs (except for 4th pair PPs).  </li>
<li>Multi-way vs. IP stab: Gear up our equity requirements for continuing on with the hand. Fold the bottom portions of both the XR bluff range and the XC range.  </li>
<li>When isolation raising out of position (from BB or SB), proceed with the 3bet OOP Aggressor standard line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU after flop X through: Delay c-bet stab entire range, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>Exception: If we hold a broadway pair and the turn is an over card (this becomes a check).</li>
<li>HU after flop XR: Barrel premium value. ONLY continue bluffing with 8-out straight draw+ or 9-out flush draw+, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>After flop XC: X entire range. Assess vs. bet accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>River</h3>
<ul>
<li>After X-B: Bluff river 100%, 2/3 pot. </li>
<li>Exception: On Ace turns when we get called we will give up on the river.</li>
<li>After XR-B: Never bluff.</li>
<li>After XC-X (turn checks through): Fire all bluffs (including A-x) if either the turn or river is a broadway, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>After XC-XC: Fold all bluff-catchers that don't dominate a portion of villain's value-betting range. Note: we will be creating bridges (exceptions to rules) for this metric as we proceed with the course, but in general this line is under-bluffed by villain.</li>
<li>Vs. river raise: Do NOT bluff-catch vs. any opponent profile. We need significant domination over villain's value raising range to justify a call. </li>

<h2>2.2 - Single Raise OOP Defender</h2>
<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU and multi-way: X entire range.</li>
<li>Vs. c-bet: standard hotspot XR strategy applies. As a benchmark, overall fold vs flop C-bet should not be higher than 35%. This, combined with overfolding BB v pre flop steal, are two of the biggest red-line leaks. BB fold vs BTN steal should be under 35%. </li>
<li>Multi-way vs. c-bet: Do not apply hotspots with a player left to act. Increase equity requirements for hotspots when closing the action vs. a player who has bet into a multiway pot.</li>

</ul>
<h3>River</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vs. villain's X-C: After delayed C-betting the turn and getting called, we are following through on all rivers (2/3 sizing). Bet all bluffs and a polarized value range (we will check our merged section and play for showdown). Exception: Ace rivers are code red.</li>
<li>Vs. villain's B-X (turn checks through): Fire all bluffs (including A-x), 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>Vs. villain's BC-X: Check all bluffs. We never reopen the betting on the river with bluffs after we XR flop and the turn checks through.</li>

<h2>3.1 - 3bet OOP Aggressor</h2>

<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU: c-bet entire range, 1/3 pot.  </li>
<li>Multi-way: bet strong top pair+. We need at least BDFD/BDSD+2 overcards, or BDFD+BDSD+1 overcard to bluff, 1/3 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. raise: call any over-card+BDFD, naked gutter, or any pair on most boards. Exceptions would be highly interactive boards. We should fold more here vs. the raise. These situations need to be assessed on a case-by-base basis.</li>

<li>HU:
<li>Barrel with strong top pair+ as well as gutters/straight draws/flush draws, 2/3 pot. </li>
<li>X with value weaker than top pair</li>
<li>X bluffs weaker than gutters. Exception: Pairing turns on any board and low turns on low, disconnected boards are pressure cards for villain's calling range. We can bluff these very light since villain will likely over-fold.</li>
<li>HU vs. stab (after we X): Rarely fold middle pair on any board. Call any pair on disconnected boards. On ace turns, fold all pairs except top pair (a pair of aces).</li>
<li>HU vs. raise: Do not bet-fold top pair+ vs. jam when SPR is low. With depth, villain is less likely to be merging and we need significant value domination to call.</li>

    <h2>Glossary</h2>
    <h3>Assumptive ranging</h3>
    <p>Making biased assessments about the villain's range which are unrealistic and/or emotionally driven.</p>
    <h3>Base rate of bluffs (BROB)</h3>
    <p>The extent of our opponent's "natural" bluffing range. Primarily used on streets before the river, this categorizes "obvious" bluffing hands on boards where those hands might be the most likely bluffs in a player's range. For example, a player's BROB on a flush-draw board might be to bluff with all flush draws as a minimum. On a board with a flush draw and straight draw, it might be to bluff with all flush draws and straight draws, while on a very blank board with no draws at all, a player's BROB may include bluffing with air hands, overcards, or simply not at all.</p>
    <h3>Blocker</h3>
    <p>A hand or card which, via card removal effects, lowers the likelihood of our opponent possessing a specific type of hand in their range, e.g. when we have top set, we have two blockers to top pair, making it unlikely our opponent has top pair, and weakening their range as a by-product. When we have an under-pair to the board (e.g. 44 on K-T-7), we unblock nearly all board-pairing hands, and thus are more likely to run into a hand that has connected with the board in some way.</p>
    <h3>Bluff allowance (BA)</h3>
    <p>An estimated proportion of value combinations to bluff combinations in the villain's range. The more value combinations an opponent has in their range, the higher their Bluff Allowance, because they can bluff more without becoming imbalanced. The less value combinations an opponent has in their range, the lower their Bluff Allowance, because they're simply not able to bluff as frequently.</p><br>
    <p>The other side of the equation, the higher the villain's Base Rate of Bluffs (BROB), the more easily they can overshoot their BA in situations where they do not have a lot of value in their range. An example of a high BROB is a board with a lot of missed draws - there are many combinations of hands that end up on the river needing to bluff in order to win the pot. If a villain has a low BROB, for example on a triple-broadway board, then they cannot easily overshoot their BA even when they do not have a lot of value in their range.</p><br>
    <p>The higher the villain's BA, the less interested we are in bluff catching, and vice versa.</p><br>
    <p>Note that a high BA does not imply villain is bluffing with too high of a frequency - in fact, it implies the opposite, that they are able to bluff with a higher frequency before crossing the threshold into over-bluffing, and thus it is less likely that they are over-bluffing to the extent that bluff-catching is a good idea.</p>
    <h3>Capped/uncapped range</h3>
    <p>A range is capped if it contains no high-equity or nut hands. An uncapped range is similar to a protected range, although a range can be protected while still being capped.</p><br>
    <p>We may also discuss a player's range in terms of where the cap on their range is located - for example, we may describe a player as being "capped at top pair", if their range contains no hands stronger than top pair.</p>
    <h3>Code red</h3>
    <p>A board, turn card or river card is said to be "Code Red" if there are a large number of potentially very strong hands possible in the range of our opponent. This could be because the board ran out four to a straight or four to a flush, or simply because a turn or river card peeled off that hit our opponent's range very hard.</p>
    <p>In Tier 4 we will learn that the standard for code red is higher for the volatility profile than other profiles. Code red for a confirmed volatile generally requires a 4-card straight or 4-card flush on board.</p>
    <h3>Condensed range</h3>
    <p>A range concentrated toward weak to medium strength showdown value, usually as a result of calling a previous street.</p>
    <h3>Confidence interval</h3>
    <p>When a profile is unclear, we use a confidence interval to determine the action that will perform best on average against the range of possible profiles.</p>
    <h3>Data point analysis</h3>
    <p>An analysis that examines all the relevant facts and statistics in a hand and then determines which ones are most relevant and/or necessary for consideration in order to arrive at a correct decision.</p>
    <h3>Domination</h3>
    <p>When we possess significant domination over our opponent's range, it means our hand has extremely high equity versus certain specific portions of that range. This signifies that our equity, and thus in most cases our EV, will be much higher than if we possessed no domination, and were therefore only marginally ahead of most of our opponent's value range. Domination is very often achieved through our having our opponent out-kicked in some fashion - for example, top pair top kicker versus top pair second kicker, or top two pair versus top pair and third pair.</p>
    <h3>Elasticity/inelasticity</h3>
    <p>Elasticity refers to the amount of impact bet sizing has on a calling frequency. Elastic ranges are usually depolarized and call less or more as bet size increases or decreases. Inelastic calling ranges are usually very polarized and call at the same frequency regardless of bet sizing.    </p>
    <h3>Equity-driven range</h3>
    <p>An equity-driven range is a range constructed primarily by way of choosing bluffing hands according to their equity in the current pot. For example, flop c-bet bluffing ranges on more dynamic boards will often be highly equity-driven, since players are reluctant to bluff with low-equity hands on boards where they stand a lower chance of getting a fold.</p>
    <h3>Exploitable/exploitative</h3>
    <p>Any deviation from GTO or unexploitable strategy is exploitable; an opponent can adapt their strategy away from GTO to increase their EV versus this strategy. An exploitative strategy is one aimed at targeting an exploitable weakness in an opponent. The two go hand in hand - when we are playing exploitatively, we become exploitable. Thus, we should recognize that exploiting a weakness in our opponent's game opens up a potential hole in our own game.</p>
    <h3>Forced aggression</h3>
    <p>A reckless bluffing line that is generally negative EV because it is trying to push the opponent off of a range which contains too much value. Most commonly used to describe bluffing lines that go beyond the level of aggression recommended as part of a GTO or baseline exploitative strategy for a specific situation.</p>
    <h3>Formation (preflop)</h3>
    <p>A descriptor for the general preflop circumstances of a hand-players, positions, and how this affects preflop ranges.</p>
    <h3>Game theory optimal (GTO)</h3>
    <p>Refers to the best of all possible unexploitable strategies, a perfect strategy. Can be quantified for specific situations, must be abstracted in order to deal with more complex, holistic scenarios</p>
    <h3>Hotspot</h3>
    <p>A hotspot is a strategic data point that has been identified through mass data analysis as representing a weakness in the player pool's overall game, usually a weakness involving folding too much in relation to what GTO play would suggest. Poker Detox requirements for a hotspot are a difference of ≥7% between PIO Solver's and the pool's defense frequency for a given line.</p>
    <h3>Linear range</h3>
    <p>A range that starts with the highest-equity hands and moves downwards in equity until it reaches a specific stopping point.</p>
    <h3>Mandatory defense frequency (MDF)</h3>
    <p>The rate at which a player is required to defend their range (by calling or raising) when facing a bet in a specific situation, in order to remain unexploitable. Also known as Minimum Defense Frequency - these two terms are interchangeable</p>
    <h3>Mass data analysis (MDA)</h3>
    <p>The collection and inspection of large samples of hand histories in order to assess the player pool's tendencies in specific lines and exploit those tendencies when they are imbalanced.</p>
    <h3>Merged range</h3>
    <p>When the value component of a range becomes depolarized. An example would be c-betting 100% of our range in position on the flop. A merging error refers to taking hands that should usually check or call in a specific spot and betting or raising them instead. As pot size increases, it generally becomes a bigger mistake to bet merged.</p>
    <h3>Outside tier capacity (OTC)</h3>
    <p>Outside of tier capacity means the student does not yet have the skillset to properly analyze the hand. If this is the case, the student should fold when facing aggression.</p><br>
    <p>Remember: Uncertainty + Aggression = Fold</p>
    <h3>Perceived range (PR)</h3>
    <p>An estimation by the hero of how the villain has ranged him based on his actions in the hand. PR is made weaker by passive actions and stronger by aggressive actions. The stronger our PR is, the less interested we are in bluffcatching - this is because it is significantly less likely that our opponents will try to bluff us if our range is perceived to contain many very strong hands.</p><br>
    <p> Tier 4 we will learn that PR is only applied to regs. It is disregarded when playing against fish or recreational players because their understanding of ranging concepts is poor or nonexistent.</p>
    <h3>Playability</h3>
    <p>A hand is more 'playable' if it stands a good chance of being able to continue further into the hand on a frequent basis. Hands that have a tendency to flop strong pairs and draws have good playability, while hands that frequently flop weakly and will rarely have many outs to improve (such as low pocket pairs) tend to have poor playability.</p><br>
    <p>Playability is closely related to equity retention - a hand with good playability will retain some equity even against the strongest portions of an opponent's range, while a hand with poor playability may seem to have reasonable equity if the hand were to be all-in right away, but will struggle to negotiate future streets comfortably, and may be drawing dead in the event that it runs into the top of the opponent's range.</p>
    <h3>Polarized range</h3>
    <p>A range containing a combination of strong, high-equity hands and weak, low-equity hands, with very little or nothing in the middle (merged) region. A polarization error refers to betting merged hands which generally get called by better hands and fold worse hands in the villain's range.</p>
    <h3>Profiling</h3>
    <p>The use of HUD stats, line recognition, and/or showdown information to predict or assess a player's behavior and exploit it. Usually associated with a desire to develop a specific profile of each opponent, assessing them according to specific villain archetypes.</p>
    <h3>Protected range</h3>
    <p>A range which contains a significant amount of nutted or near-nutted hands. Usually used to refer to a range that also contains some amount of non-nutted hands in addition - the weaker hands are protected by the stronger ones, because an opponent will need to play cautiously for fear of running into the nuts.</p>
    <h3>Pushing equity</h3>
    <p>A range is said to be pushing equity when it is at a value advantage over another range. In other words, if the action was frozen (no more bets can be places) the range that is the favorite to win the pot is the range that is pushing equity.</p>
    <h3>Randomized range</h3>
    <p>The opposite of a linear range, this is a mixed strategy usually involving incorporating a variety of different types of hands with variable frequencies. Since strong players adopting mixed strategies will usually have a much more specific approach to range construction, ranges that are partially randomized are usually only adopted by inexperienced players using an uncalculated approach. Ranges are never fully randomized, since even the weakest players recognize the strength of a premium hand.</p>
    <h3>Realization</h3>
    <p>The act of checking or calling a bet with the intention of seeing future streets for the minimum price. When we call or check in position, we guarantee seeing the next street, and thus are able to achieve greater realization of our hand's pot equity. If we choose to bet in such a spot, we may risk being forced to fold a hand with reasonable pot equity if we were to get raised.</p><br>
    <p>We use the term 'realization' because when we check or call with the intention of allowing ourselves to see a future street, we are literally making our equity into a reality - we're taking a hand that has a certain percentage chance to win at showdown, and deliberately bringing ourselves closer to showdown in an attempt to turn our theoretical share of the pot into reality.</p>
    <h3>Showdown-driven range</h3>
    <p>A range that includes a capped inelastic component and an air component, with which a player is likely to call a bet more often than is optimal. This is due to having an abnormally large number of hands of similar strength that can call to win the pot. For example, a player may call all of the A-x in his range on a low, double-paired board.</p><br>
    <p> A player can also be showdown-driven when he feels his opponent's value-betting range is unorthodox, i.e. the opponent cannot be repping much.</p>
    <h3>Standard line (SL)</h3>
    <p>A simplified set of instructions for common scenarios which takes three basic inputs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Action (line and current street)</li>
        <li>Board texture (hotspots, overcards, 4-card straight/flush)</li>
        <li>Hand strength (domination, polarization)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a standard line is not followed, it is called a standard line deviation. A deviation is not necessarily a mistake - it is a neutral term, used to describe a play that is outside of our system. When a standard line is not followed and is clearly -EV, it is called a standard line violation. When a deviation is made for clear and specific data point reasons and is likely more +EV than the standard line, it is called a standard line bridge. This term is used because we are creating a bridge between our 'standard' framework and a newer, more unconventional set of ideas - we're stepping into new strategic territory.</p><br>
    <p>In summary:</p>
    <table>
    <tr><td>Good(+EV)</td> <td>Neutral</td>	<td>Bad (-EV)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bridge</td>	<td>Deviation</td>	<td>Violation</td></tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Standard line bridge</h3>
    <p>A bridge occurs when we shift from a rigid analytical framework into an expanded perspective that factors in additional information, game flow reads, or exploitative strategies, we are bridging from our existing 'standard' framework into new strategic territory. Broadly speaking, we are moving from GTO play into an exploitative paradigm when we do this - the bridge we create is the one that connects GTO with exploitative play.</p><br>
    <p>Example usages:</p><br>
    <p>"Usually we would bet a small sizing in this spot, but with our unique reads on this opponent, we can bridge into a strategy that also uses some large bets."</p><br>
    <p>"Our standard line here says to bet 100%, but bridging to a strategy that involves some checking is acceptable with the right reads."</p>
    <h3>Standard line deviation</h3>
    <p>An action that does not follow the standard line for a specific situation. A deviation can be either a good play or a mistake, right or wrong, +EV or -EV. For example, checking back in position on the flop instead of c-betting.</p>
    <h3>Standard line violation</h3>
    <p>Any action that is both a deviation from the standard lines and is considered -EV. For example, calling river check-raise without domination on the villain's value range.</p>
    <h3>Unexploitable</h3>
    <p>An unexploitable play or strategy is a fundamentally correct one, to which our opponent is unable to profitably adapt. No matter what our opponent does, their EV is the same or worse than any other approach. Unexploitable play is the foundation of GTO strategy - there exist a number of different ways to play each situation unexploitably (e.g. each different potential bet sizing can be utilized with a perfectly balanced range), but only the highest-EV of these strategies can be said to be GTO for a specific player (e.g. choosing the correct bet sizing, and ensuring that we bet that sizing with a balanced range).</p>
    <h3>Volatility</h3>
    <p>Primary usage is to refer to a villain whose tendencies will be less consistent and far less calculated than a high-level player. A volatile player frequently does things that don't make sense, generally plays a higher-VPIP style, and will play bigger pots than the average, often by virtue of utilizing unusually large bet sizings.</p>
    <p>Secondary usage is to refer to the overall extent of fluctuation between one outcome and another, e.g. a play that results in the hero either winning or losing a big pot is a play that subjects us to greater volatility, while a play that minimizes pot size is less volatile.</p>

</div>
<div class="divClass" id="div12">
    <h2>Profiles</h2>
    <h3>1. Volatile</h3>
    <p>The volatile is a recreational player whose behavior is theoretically unsound and overly aggressive.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bluffing frequency trends very high, so we can call much lighter than normal, except in the most under-bluffed lines.</li>
        <li>Calling ranges trend too wide, so we can bet for thin value or use larger sizings than normal. (Hot-spots still apply.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Weak fish</h3>
    <p>The weak fish is a recreational player whose behavior is theoretically unsound and overly passive.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bluffing frequency trends very low and value bets are frequently missed. Generally we are not interested in bluff catching, but there are some exceptions (very low BA zones).</li>
        <li>Calling ranges trend too wide, so we can bet for thin value or use larger sizings than normal. (Hot-spots still apply.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: It may sound like a contradiction to say that we can value bet thin vs. recreational players because they call too wide, but also barrel hot-spots and expect them to over-fold. The reason this is true is because their preflop ranges are too wide. This reduces their postflop playability, so their calling range will be too weak on average since it contains both sub-optimal draws and sub-optimal value hands.</p>
    <h3>3.Low-level reg (LR)</h3>
    <p>The low reg is a non-recreational player whose strategy is somewhat theoretically sound, but trends toward passivity and has fundamental polarization leaks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bluffing frequency trends low and value bets are sometimes missed. We can feel very confident auto-folding bluff catchers in under-bluffed lines and inconclusive/high BA zones.</li>
        <li>Calling frequency is sub-optimal, so we can increase aggression in over-folded zones.</li>
        <li>Polarization errors can be significant, especially in low SPR zones. We can call lighter than normal in lines that are commonly merged.</li>
        <li>Basic competence in ranging opponents. Mostly capable of recognizing a protected range. We can auto-fold bluff catchers when our perceived range is strong.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. High-level reg</h3>
    <p>The high reg is a non-recreational, most likely professional player whose strategy is theoretically sound and whose aggression and defense frequencies are much closer to optimal than other profiles. They also have the capacity to use exploitatively high aggression in zones that are incentivized by general player-pool passivity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High competence in ranging opponents. Capable of identifying and pressuring a capped range. We can call lighter than normal when our perceived range is weak, especially vs. exploitatively large bet sizes (>3/4 pot).</li>
        <li>Capable of using unorthodox or apparently volatile lines as value traps. We can fold exploitatively when we see a high reg in an unorthodox line.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Identifying profiles with VPIP/PFR stats</h2>
    <p>We primarily use two stats when profiling: VPIP and PFR</p><br>
    <p><b>Volatile:</b>  >40 VPIP, >15 PFR, (high gap)</p><br>
    <p>A volatile player has a high PFR and a high VPIP/PFR gap. This gap causes their limp and cold call ranges to be skewed much more toward low playability than their PFR range. Our main exploit is to call wider than normal when facing aggression vs. these players in these lines. In some cases, a volatile can have a high enough PFR (62/30+) that he also flops with low playability when raising into pot. Under these conditions, we become very interested in bluffcatching on low-medium BA runouts. The main thing to remember about volatiles is that they trend more volatile in their limp and cold call lines, and we should be more interested in bluff-catching vs them in these lines.</p><br>
    <p><b>Weak fish:</b> >30 VPIP, <10 PFR (high gap)</p><br>
    <p>A weak fish has a very low PFR and a high VPIP/PFR gap. Like the volatile, the weak fish plays a lot of hands, but generally does far less betting and raising than a volatile. It's important to note that the weak fish does draw some post flop correlation to volatility, specifically with regard to merge raising flop and merge raising all in at low SPR. The important thing to note is that the weak fish is generally more passive than the volatile, and therefore we will do less large pot bluff-catching vs late street aggression vs the weak fish.</p><br>
    <p>Players with a sub-10 PFR who have a VPIP of below 30 are classified as a sub-profile, which we will call the "nit fish". The nit fish is a tighter version of the weak fish. We should feel even more confident folding bluff-catchers vs. aggression to the nit, since he generally arrives at the flop with higher playability due to a tighter preflop strategy. We should also gear up our value betting thresholds due to his tighter preflop strategy. In general, hot spots still apply vs the nit.</p><br>
    <p><b>Low reg:</b> 20-40 VPIP, 10-15 PFR</p>
    <p><b>High reg:</b> 20-40 VPIP, 20-35 PFR (<15% gap)</p>
    <p>The low and high regs both have a VPIP range of 20-40. The low reg has a PFR range of 10-15. The high reg has a higher PFR and a lower VPIP/PFR gap.</p>
    <h3>Trending profiles</h3>
    <p>There will be many cases where an opponent's stats will come close to fitting in two different profile types. For example, a 39/14 player technically fits in the low reg profile, but is also very close to the volatile profile (add 2% to VPIP and you have a volatile profile). In this case, we say the player is low reg, trending volatile. We need to keep an eye out for volatile behavior, but we cannot act on the volatility read exploitatively until we have confirmation. In order for a trending volatile to become a confirmed volatile, we need to observe a substantial information exchange in the form of volatile trending action, or volatile showdown holdings.</p><br>
    <p>In other cases you might see regs whose stats don't fit neatly into the high or low reg profile. Take a 36/17, for example. PFR is too high for a low reg, but the gap is too large for a high reg. In this case, we just treat the profile as a low/high reg, or "hybrid reg". In order to clarify a trending reg profile, we need to observe a substantial information exchange in the form of aggression tendencies or polarization errors.</p>
    <h3>Information transfer</h3>
    <p>Information transfer is when a player's behavior (action, stack size, or showdown) gives us a better understanding of his profile type. It is usually our second line of defense for profiling. It can help us to confirm a specific profile when a player's stats are trending or unclear.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Action</th>                     <th>Low Reg</th>	<th>High Reg</th>   </tr>
        <tr><td>Full stack</td>	                <td>x</td>	        <td>x</td>          </tr>
        <tr><td>Missed value</td>	            <td>x</td>          <td></td>	        </tr>

        <caption>Table 1: Information exchange for reg profiles.</caption>            
    </table>
    <p>If a player is full-stacked, he is more likely to be a reg. As a general rule of thumb, the deeper the stack the more likely the player is to be a high reg. Volatiles and weak fish can sometimes buy in for a full stack, it's just more common among reg profiles to play full stacked. We also need to be aware that a volatile could just be in the midst of a winning session, and that is why he is sitting full stacked or deeper.</p><br>
    <p><b>Suggestion:</b> During a session, you should be color coding or labeling the different player profiles on your HUD in some way. We also suggest labeling short stacks immediately upon being seated. If a short stack doubles up, that information will be lost and we could miss out on a valuable exploitative opportunity.</p><br>
    <p>If you see a reg make a significant merging error or miss a clear value bet, you can use that information as confirmation that he is a low reg, not a high reg.</p><br>
    <p>If you see a reg using aggression in zones where your perceived range is capped, especially by using a large sizing, you can confirm that the player is a high reg.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Action</th>                     <th>Weak Fish</th>	<th>Volatile</th>   </tr>

        <caption>Table 2: Information exchange for fish profiles.</caption>            
    </table>
    <p>Note that many of these actions apply to both the volatile and a weak fish. For example, if a player donks into us, then we cannot immediately label him volatile because both the volatile and the weak fish use the donk line. The difference is the weak fish uses the donk line with a more equity-driven range than the volatile, comprised mostly of medium/strong pairs, some premiums, and some semi-bluffs. The volatile donks with a much wider range with all types of hands, including air.</p><br>
    <p>The same goes for short stackers, limpers, and players who use strange bet sizes like min-bets, min-raises, or large c-bets. The only actions that can single-handedly confirm volatility are large merged jams preflop, or reckless bluffs.</p><br>
    <p>A player showing a bluff is not enough to label him volatile. Many bluffs fit into a well-balanced strategy. A reckless bluff, on the other hand, is one that does not fit anywhere in a well-balanced strategy. A reckless bluff can be loosely defined as extensive polarization (single or multi-street) performed by air or very merged value when our range is protected.</p><br>
    <p>It can be tempting to jump to conclusions about volatility because our highest win-rate comes from exploiting volatile players. It is important to be careful to stick to the information transfer guidelines and not over-apply them. Telling stories about a player's behavior without any real profile confirmation can lead to dangerous miscalculations vs non-volatiles. Statements like, "Villain was splashing around too much," or, "Villain was raising me a lot," are subjective stories. They are not confirmation of volatility. Mistakenly assigning volatility can quickly turn one of the sharpest tools in your arsenal into one of your biggest leaks.</p><br>
    <p>Stats should be your primary tool for assessing profile. They are both more reliable than information transfer and less subjective. When stats are trending toward a certain profile type, we can use information transfer for confirmational support, but we must be careful not to over apply it.</p>
    <h3>Confidence intervals</h3>
    <p>We believe profiling is best thought about in the sense of gradients, and not in binaries. Profiling allows us to use a player's actions and stats to predict and exploit his behavioral tendencies, but in real games it is rarely done in a cut-and-dry way. There are usually variations in how well a player's stats fit the guidelines for a particular profile, subtleties in information exchange, or textural nuances, which increase the complexity of real-world scenarios. In practice, profiling amounts to gradually increasing or decreasing our requirements for playability based on the confidence we have in our profile reads. When a profile is not perfectly clear, we use a confidence interval to determine the action that will perform best on average against the range of possible profiles.</p><br>
    <p>Let's look at an example of how we might construct a confidence interval for a common flop check raise scenario. (We are the IP aggressor in a single-raised pot, and our flop c-bet gets check raised heads up.)</p><br>
    <h4>Constructing a confidence interval: example 1</h4>
    <p><b>Board: KhTs6h Hand:Kc2c</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vs. volatile, call-call-call on non-code-red runouts. This is the best way to exploit the volatile's high bluffing frequency.</li>
        <li>Vs. non-volatile or unconfirmed, call flop, call low-BA turns, and fold river. The reason we are folding river is because the pool gives us too much realization when they shut down with their missed draws. Rarely are players three-street bluffing in these spots.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Constructing a confidence interval: example 2</h3>
    <p>Same scenario as Example 1, facing the flop check raise heads up.</p>
    <p><b>Board: KhKs6d Hand:QhQd</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vs. volatile, call-call-call on non-code-red run-outs.</li>
        <li>Vs. non-volatile or unconfirmed, call flop and fold turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The reason we would fold all turns here vs a non-volatile is because on this texture, it's much harder for villain to arrive at the turn with equity driven semi-bluffs. Due to this texture subtlety, we can say that the non-volatile player's BA on the turn will naturally be higher, since those players are more competent, and not inclined to run multi-street bluff lines without substantial drawing equity. Volatile players on the other hand lack this type of competence, and for that reason we would be calling flop to call both turn and river, since it's virtually impossible for this board to run out code-red - this made our volatile assessment easier because there are no non-code-red run-outs possible on this board.</p><br>
    <p>This is the essence of a confidence interval: We always construct the best exploitative course of action vs. all possible profiles. If we have significant profile reads, we choose the action that best exploits that profile. If we have incomplete profile reads, we choose the action that best exploits the hybrid profile on average. If we have no profile reads, we choose the best course of action vs. the pool in general. Our first line of defense vs. the unknown profile is mass database analysis, because that allows us to exploit the pool. If we have no MDA to fall back on, then we are not confident in any exploit, and we revert to a theory-oriented approach.</p><br>
    <p>You will see more examples of these confidence intervals in the Case Studies section. Becoming fluent confidence intervals will unlock a new level of exploitative power. You will be able to take what you have learned in the first three Tiers of the course and make adjustments to those instructions which will further improve your win-rate.</p>

<h2> 1.1 - Single Raise IP Aggressor</h2>
<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU: C-bet entire range, 1/3 pot.</li>
<li>Exception vs. SB: Bet top pair+ on double-broadway, middle pair+ on single-broadway, all pairs on low boards (ten-high boards), 1/3 pot. Only bluff with BDFD/BDSD+2 overcards, or BDFD+BDSD+1 overcard. We do not c-bet range vs. SB because the SB range typically flops with much higher equity than the BB range.
Multi-way:</li>
<li>C-bet for value with top pair+, or mid pair+ on low boards (no broadways), 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>C-bet bluff with FD, SD, gutter, or BDFD/BDSD + 2 over-cards, 2/3 pot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU vs. XC-X:</li>
<li>C-bet for value with top pair+ (as long as no 4-card straight/flush completed).</li>
<li>C-bet bluff with gutter+.</li>
<li>X back with middle-low pairs.</li>
<li>X back with weak bluffs except on paired or flush-closing turns, or boards that were paired on the flop. These are hot-spots, bet 2/3 pot with all bluffs.</li>
<li>Vs. XR: Auto-fold bluff catchers. Draws need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis considering implied and direct pot odds.</li>
<li>HU vs. SB X-X: delay stab entire range, 1/2 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. XR-X:</li>
<li>Bet top pair second kicker+. We do not bet-fold top pair to the double-XR all-in when the raise is 6x or less. We fold top pair to any double-XR that is not all-in. (This includes raises from an effective stack of less than 6x. The all-in raise is significantly more merged than the small check raise.)</li>
<li>Check back all other value.</li>
<li>Fire all bluffs, 1/2 pot. Exception: Ace high can be checked.</li>
</ul>


<h3> River </h3>
<ul>
<li>HU vs. XC-XC-X:</li>
<li>No value betting instruction. We need to evaluate on a case by case basis.</li>
<li>This is a hot-spot. Bluff all hands without showdown value from all positions vs. BB, 2/3 pot. You should especially be interested in bluffing connected boards on brick rivers due to the abundance of pair+draw in villains range that will peel turn and fold to river bet. Example: AQ on 984, T, x</li>
<li>Exception vs. SB: Only bluff if the river is a broadway over-card, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. SB X-XC-X: Only bluff if the river is a broadway over-card, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>Vs. XC-XR-X: Never reopen for thin value after calling the turn XR.</li>
<li>HU vs. XC-X-X: This is a hot-spot. Bluff all hands without showdown value, 1/2 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. XR-X-B: Fold without domination.</li>
<li>Vs. XR: Never bluff-catch vs. any opponent profile. We need significant domination over villain's value raising range to justify a call.</li>
<li>Vs. any OOP multi-street aggression (XC-XR-B, XR-B-B): do NOT bluff-catch.</li>
<li>Vs. blocker bet: Never bluff raise.</li>
<li> </li>
<li>Notes:</li>
<li>Play vs. a single limp-caller as you would play vs. the big blind.</li>
<li>We do not have standardized floating requirements vs. the flop check raise because there are too many formation and interactivity nuances to discuss here. This will be taught in more depth in Tier 2 when we introduce the concept of playability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2 - Single Raise IP Defender</h2>

<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU vs. X: stab entire range, 1/2 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. c-bet: float all BDFD+.</li>
<li>Multi-way vs. c-bet: increase requirements substantially for weakest calls relative to HU. Gutters+ and midpair + is a good starting instruction.</li>
<li>Multi-way vs. X: bet medium-strength pairs+ and robust draws (gutters+), 1/2 pot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU after villain B-X: stab entire range, 1/2 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. XC-X: barrel top pair+, gutters+, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>Vs. XR: Autofold bluff catchers. Draws need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis considering implied and direct pot odds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>River</h3>
<ul>
<li>After villain B-XC-X or XC-X-X or XC-XC-X: Never bluff.</li>
<li>After villain B-B-X: Stab 1/2 pot without showdown value.</li>
<li>Vs. XR: Do NOT bluffcatch vs. any opponent profile. We need significant domination over villain's value raising range to justify a call.</li>
<li>Vs. any OOP multistreet aggression (B-B-B): Do NOT bluffcatch.</li>

<h2>2.1 - Single Raise OOP Aggressor</h2>

<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU: X entire range.</li>
<li>Multi-way: Bet top pair+ and gutters+, 2/3 pot. </li>
<li>HU vs. IP stab: apply hot-spot XR strategy with bluffs, XC all pairs (except for 4th pair PPs).  </li>
<li>Multi-way vs. IP stab: Gear up our equity requirements for continuing on with the hand. Fold the bottom portions of both the XR bluff range and the XC range.  </li>
<li>When isolation raising out of position (from BB or SB), proceed with the 3bet OOP Aggressor standard line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU after flop X through: Delay c-bet stab entire range, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>Exception: If we hold a broadway pair and the turn is an over card (this becomes a check).</li>
<li>HU after flop XR: Barrel premium value. ONLY continue bluffing with 8-out straight draw+ or 9-out flush draw+, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>After flop XC: X entire range. Assess vs. bet accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>River</h3>
<ul>
<li>After X-B: Bluff river 100%, 2/3 pot. </li>
<li>Exception: On Ace turns when we get called we will give up on the river.</li>
<li>After XR-B: Never bluff.</li>
<li>After XC-X (turn checks through): Fire all bluffs (including A-x) if either the turn or river is a broadway, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>After XC-XC: Fold all bluff-catchers that don't dominate a portion of villain's value-betting range. Note: we will be creating bridges (exceptions to rules) for this metric as we proceed with the course, but in general this line is under-bluffed by villain.</li>
<li>Vs. river raise: Do NOT bluff-catch vs. any opponent profile. We need significant domination over villain's value raising range to justify a call. </li>
<li>No value betting instruction. We need to evaluate on a case-by-case basis.</li>

<h2>2.2 - Single Raise OOP Defender</h2>
<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU and multi-way: X entire range.</li>
<li>Vs. c-bet: standard hotspot XR strategy applies. As a benchmark, overall fold vs flop C-bet should not be higher than 35%. This, combined with overfolding BB v pre flop steal, are two of the biggest red-line leaks. BB fold vs BTN steal should be under 35%. </li>
<li>Multi-way vs. c-bet: Do not apply hotspots with a player left to act. Increase equity requirements for hotspots when closing the action vs. a player who has bet into a multiway pot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU after flop XR: Barrel premium value. ONLY continue bluffing with 8-out straight draw+ or 9-out flush draw+, 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>HU after villain X on flop: delay c-bet stab entire range, 2/3 pot. Exception: Ace turns are code-red.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>River</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vs. villain's X-C: After delayed C-betting the turn and getting called, we are following through on all rivers (2/3 sizing). Bet all bluffs and a polarized value range (we will check our merged section and play for showdown). Exception: Ace rivers are code red.</li>
<li>Vs. villain's B-X (turn checks through): Fire all bluffs (including A-x), 2/3 pot.</li>
<li>Vs. villain's BC-X: Check all bluffs. We never reopen the betting on the river with bluffs after we XR flop and the turn checks through.</li>
<li>After we XC-XC: Fold all bluffcatchers that don't dominate a portion of Villain's value-betting range.  Note: we will be creating bridges (exceptions to rules) for this metric as we proceed with the course, but in general this line is underbluffed by villain.</li>
<li>Vs. river raise: Do NOT bluffcatch vs any opponent profile. We need significant domination over villain's value raising range to justify a call. </li>

<h2>3.1 - 3bet OOP Aggressor</h2>
<ul>
<li>When isolation raising out of position (from SB or BB), proceed with the 3bet OOP Aggressor standard line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flop</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU: c-bet entire range, 1/3 pot.  </li>
<li>Multi-way: bet strong top pair+. We need at least BDFD/BDSD+2 overcards, or BDFD+BDSD+1 overcard to bluff, 1/3 pot.</li>
<li>HU vs. raise: call any over-card+BDFD, naked gutter, or any pair on most boards. Exceptions would be highly interactive boards. We should fold more here vs. the raise. These situations need to be assessed on a case-by-base basis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<ul>
<li>HU:
<li>Barrel with strong top pair+ as well as gutters/straight draws/flush draws, 2/3 pot. </li>
<li>X with value weaker than top pair</li>
<li>X bluffs weaker than gutters. Exception: Pairing turns on any board and low turns on low, disconnected boards are pressure cards for villain's calling range. We can bluff these very light since villain will likely over-fold.</li>
<li>HU vs. stab (after we X): Rarely fold middle pair on any board. Call any pair on disconnected boards. On ace turns, fold all pairs except top pair (a pair of aces).</li>
<li>HU vs. raise: Do not bet-fold top pair+ vs. jam when SPR is low. With depth, villain is less likely to be merging and we need significant value domination to call.</li>
</ul>
<h3>River</h3>
<ul>
<li>After B-B: never bluff.  </li>
<li>After we B-XC-X or BC-XC-X or B-BC-X or B-X-X: Call a bet only with significant value domination. Bluff catching is usually outside tier capacity in these zones. </li>
<li>After B-X (both players X turn): Fire all bluffs, 2/3 pot. This is a hot-spot. Play conventionally with value hands, but turn your very worst one pair hands into bluffs.</li>

<li>HU vs. XR-X:</li>
<li>Bet top pair second kicker+. We do not bet-fold top pair to the double-XR all-in when the raise is 6x or less. We fold top pair to any double-XR that is not all-in.

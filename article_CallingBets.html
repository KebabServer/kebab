        <h1>Calling Bets</h1>

        <h2>A Framework for Facing Bets in Open Action Spots </h2>
        <p>Whenever you face a bet there is a certain amount of EV expressed as a percentage of the new pot after
            you call that you will need to get in order to break even by calling. We will call this your Required
            Pot Share.</p>
        <p>We can calculate what this by asking what % of the new pot (after you call) your investment will equate
            to.</p>
        <p>But we can only estimate your actual pot share and whether you can hit required pot share or not by
            looking at the following factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Equity</li>
            <li>Realizability of Equity</li>
            <li>Future Fold Equity</li>
            <li>Implied Odds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Think of equity as the baseline for calling bets in open action spots (with more action remaining in the
            hand after you call). We need to adjust this for the other factors to make a best guess about our pot
            share.</p>
        <p>And we need to remember that raising for value or as a semi-bluff might be a good idea even if we know
            that calling is +EV - meaning better than folding.</p>
        <p>We shall start today's lesson with a very common spot - Facing Flop C-Bet and see how this thought
            process works, but first a word on position.</p>

        <h2>Position - The Overarching Factor</h2>

        <p>The following three factors are always better in position:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Realizability of Equity</li>
            <li>Future Fold Equity</li>
            <li>Implied Odds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In position we have the ability to continue further into the hand due to being able to control whether
            bets go in or not on future streets to a greater extent and therefore our realizability, particularly
            with unmade hands, which need fold equity when they miss and implied odds when they hit is much better.
        </p>
        <p>When we call a turn bet in position and Villain checks his air on the river we will have the chance to
            bluff with our worse air and win the pot. These spots are, moreover, favourable worlds and therefore
            bluffing is quite a bit better than 0EV.</p>
        <p>When we call a turn bet in position we have the chance to value bet river and increase the pot against
            Villain's medium, strength hands, but when out of position the river will often go check-check here as
            we do not want to build a donking range in most cases.</p>
        <p>If we call a flop bet in position we have the chance to value bet twice if Villain checks the turn.
            Contrast this t out of position where turn might go check-check and we only have the river left to value
            bet. </p>
        <p>Position helps us pick and choose our future investments with more control and therefore boosts the EV of
            calling a bet on an earlier street but it is not the only thing that affects how positive our calling
            factors are likely to be.</p>



        <h2>Example: Facing a Flop C-Bet Out of Position</h2>
        <p>
            Which option would you choose here as BB? Call or fold. Let's leave raising off the table for now.

            betsize-array="245,100,X,10,125,B33,245,150,?" width="400" height="200">

        </svg>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Equity:</b> Accoring to the solver we have 33% equity here in theory.</li>
            <li><b>Realizability of Equity:</b> Not all of this equity will be realizable if we call since we will
                face a
                turn bet at around 40-50% frequency that we cannot call on most turn cards.</li>
            <li><b>Future Fold Equity:</b> In the branches of the tree where Villain checks the turn we expect to
                have a
                profitable river bluff since the world will become a favourable one for us after we condense our
                range by calling the flop. </li>
            <li><b>Implied Odds:</b> If we hit a straight we are entitled to lots more than the new pot after we
                call so
                implied odds are clearly present in a significant way.</li>
            <li>Required Pot Share in EV = 20%.</li>
            <li>Theoretical Pot Share if we call = 32%.</li>
            <li>EV of Fold = 0BB.</li>
            <li>EV of Call = 1.1BB.</li>
            <li>EV loss of Fold = -1.1BB.</li>


        </ul>




        <h2>The - "Don't Have The Odds" Fallacy</h2>

        <p>We commit the “Don't Have The Odds” Fallacy when we only look at our equity and compare that to our
            target pot share. We must remember that target equity and target pot share are only the same thing in an
            end of action spot. </p>
        <h3>Example of the "Don't Have the Odds Fallacy" in action</h3>
        <svg class="svg_hand" card-array="90,60,8,s,135,60,8,d,180,60,6,c,305,15,K,d,350,15,T,d,135,140,J,d"
            betsize-array="245,60,X,10,80,B33,245,95,C,245,130,X,10,145,B75,245,165,F" width="400" height="200">
            <text x="120" y="45" fill="yellow" font-size="16">2Bet Pot</text>
            <text x="10" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">BTN</text>
            <text x="260" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">BB:</text>
        </svg>
        <p>WRONG: We need 30% to call and we only have 9 diamonds + 3 kings to hit = 24%.</p>
        <p>CORRECT: We have close to our required pot share just in equity then we have implied odds and the chance
            of winning with K-high.</p>
        <p>PIO wants to call and EV is ~14% of the pot.</p>

        <h2>Realizability of Equity By Hand Type</h2>

        <p> Hands that rely on winning with very marginal showdown value and that lack redraw to powerful hands are
            going to struggle to realise equity by having to fold at some point more frequently.</p>
        <p>Hands that combine SDV with improvability or have outs to nutted hands are going to have higher
            realizability by being able to continue further into the hand.</p>


        <h2>In Position is a Different Beast</h2>

        <p>When we're in position all of our pot share factors are going to be a lot more positive.</p>
        <p>Have a look at the following two sims both run on the same flop:</p>
        <img src="Images/article_Handstrength_KQ4rvsB33.png">

        <h2>Future Fold Equity</h2>

        <p>A large part of why we are allowed to call flop c-bets with flimsy hands such as backdoors and gutters
            comes down to future fold equity. In theory, when we call a BU c-bet from BB, we know that there is a
            sizable frequency of the time that our opponent does not bet the turn.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <svg class="svg_hand" card-array="90,60,K,h,135,60,Q,c,180,60,4,d,135,130,?,?,135,200,?,?,310,15,T,s,355,15,9,s"
            betsize-array="245,60,X,10,85,B33,245,95,C,245,130,X,10,140,X" width="400" height="300">
            <text x="120" y="45" fill="yellow" font-size="16">2Bet Pot</text>
            <text x="10" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">BTN</text>
            <text x="250" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">BB:</text>
            <text x="210" y="220" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">
                <tspan x="210" dy="-1em">Profitable</tspan>
                <tspan x="230" dy="+1em">Bluff</tspan>
            </text>
        </svg>

        <p>When we call this flop c-bet, we expect to see a check on the turn around 60% of the time on average
            depending on the tun card.</p>
        <p>When this happens, our range will be much stronger than Villain's because we have shed our worst hands
            and he has bet many of them and decided not to barrel a second time on this occasion.</p>
        <p>Therefore, on the river we will have a big range advantage on most run outs. When this is the case our
            fold equity, in theory, should be above our break even point for a bluff whatever sizing we pick.</p>
        <p>Therefore, getting the chance to make these profitable river bluffs is a big part of what allows us to
            call the flop and lose money the times Villain barrels the turn.</p>
        <p>WARNING: But don't get too carried away here. We still need some implied odds and equity to call the flop
            bet.
            The future fold equity alone is not sufficient alone.</p>

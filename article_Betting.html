        <h2>Reasons for Betting</h2>
        <p>Main reasons for betting are <b>value</b> and <b>bluff</b>. Denial is a useful bonus but not a
            sufficient reason for betting on its own.</p>

        <h2>Value betting</h2>

        <p>- When you bet and your opponent calls, your equity goes down. You need to have at least 50% <b>after
                you get called (finishing equity)</b> to value bet the turn and 55%-60% to value bet the river.
        </p>

        <p>- In game theory there are three different situations with respect to value betting.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You Cannot Value Bet</li>
            <li>It's Optional to Value Bet</li>
            <li>You Must Value Bet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>- And there are two key factors that determine which of the three situations you are in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Urgency</li>
            <li>Landing Equity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>You Must Value Bet</h3>
        <p>If your hand is strong enought to pick a certain bet size.</p>
        <p>AND</p>
        <p>If Urgency is high.</p>
        <h3>It's Optional to Value Bet</h3>
        <p>If your hand is strong enought to pick a certain bet size.</p>
        <p>AND</p>
        <p>If Urgency is not high.</p>
        <h3>You Cannot Value Bet</h3>
        <p>When your hand is not strong enough to pick any bet-size.</p>
        <p>OR</p>
        <p>You are not building a betting range using a sizing small enough to value bet your hand. </p>



        <h2>The Effect of Bet Sizing on Equity</h2>
        <p>The bigger you bet, the more your opponent will contract his range and the bigger the gap between your
            landing equity and finishing equity.</p>

        <h3>Required Landing Equity for Different Bet Sizes</h3>
        <p>We need to know roughly how much starting equity we'd need for each bet size for our hand to be able to
            value bet for that size.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Bet Size</th>
                <th>Minimum Landing Equity for Value Betting Wet Turn</th>
                <th>Minimum Landing Equity for Value Betting Dry Turn or River</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>B33</td>
                <td>55%</td>
                <td>65%-70%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>B75</td>
                <td>65%</td>
                <td>75%-80%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>B150</td>
                <td>75%</td>
                <td>85%-90%</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>- On wet turn spots where our hand is ahead more often than our equity suggests, we can value bet with
            lower landing equity than on dry turns or rivers where we are either way ahead or way behind.</p>
        <p>- When in position we need a little more equity to value bet as we risk re-opening the action and
            therefore checking is a slightly more viable alternative in many cases. </p>
        <p>- When out of position we need a little less equity to value bet as check is a slightly less viable
            alternative since we are not closing the action for that street by checking.</p>

        <h2>Urgency</h2>
        <p> <em>Urgency</em> refers to how imporant it is to value bet <b>Now</b>. It is dependant on the
            <b>amount
                of time
                remaing</b> in a hand to invest money compared with the average <b>investment ceiling</b> your
            hand
            wants to reach.
        </p>

        <p>- Weaker Value Betting Hands can often delay their betting until later on in the hand since they don't
            need
            to invest so much by the end.</p>
        <p>- Stronger Value Betting Hands want to invest more money by the end of the hand so they usually have to
            start making larger investments a bit earlier in the hand than weaker hands.</p>
        <p>- <b>At Shorter Stack Depths</b> urgency is lower as there is less money to be invested by the end of
            the
            hand.</p>

        <h2>Denial (aka Procetion)</h2>
        <p>Equity denial is when you prevent a player from realizing his equity by forcing him to fold before
            showdown.</p>
        <p>- Denying equity to live hands your opponent has to fold is a useful bonus but not a sufficient reason
            for
            betting. </p>
        <p>- Protection comes in handy when the fold equity you get by betting is largely useful to you.</p>



        <h2>Bluffing</h2>
        <p>- In Game Theory, like with Value Betting, there are three different situations with
            respect to bluffing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You Cannot Bluff</li>
            <li>It's Optional to Bluff</li>
            <li>You Must Bluff</li>
        </ul>
        <p>- And again there are two key factors that determine which of these three worlds you
            are in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Showdown Value</li>
            <li>World Favourability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's examine each of these in detail now.</p>
        <h3>Cannot bluff - Too much Show Down Value</h3>
        <p>- The most common factor that makes bluffing a mistake is that the hand is performing too well by
            checking for betting to be as good. </p>
        <p>- Betting with some mediocre hand may still be +EV, but as we know, making a profitable play is not our
            goal.</p>
        <p>- When check becomes too valuable due to our win % being quite high we might need to check our hand
            instead of risking extra money even if by doing so we would fold out a lot of better hands. </p>
        <h3>Unfavourable Worlds</h3>
        <p>In situations where our opponent has a large range advantage, our fold equity will be lower. In these so
            called unfavourable situations we will need to have higher standards about what we bluff. This means
            choosing only bluffs that have either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some nutted redraw (on the turn)</li>
            <li>Positive blocker effects (on the river)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Turn probe opportunities are usually unfavourable and demand a selective bluffing strategy because the
            pre-flop raiser retains an advantage when he checks behind on the flop.</p>
        <h3>Optional Bluffs</h3>
        <p>When you are not in a highly unfavourable spot and do not have too much SDV to bluff, it is likely that
            you will be in an optional bluffing spot.</p>
        <p>Spots that are very often optional bluffs when you hold both air hand and draws are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C-Betting the Turn (Double Barreling)</li>
            <li>Delayed C-Betting (Double barreling)</li>
            <li>Probing the Turn on a very low/connected board (more favourable than most turn probe opportunities)
            </li>
            <li>Betting the flop where your range is stronger than your opponent's but not massively so.</li>
            <li>Triple Barreling the river </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Must Bluff Situations</h3>
        <p>When you are in a favourable situation for your range on the river and have no SDV you must bluff.</p>
        <p>These river situations occur in two main types of spot:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You retain your pre-flop range advantage all the way through the hand either because you haven't bet
                yet or due to a very good run-out.</li>
            <li>You call a bet on an earlier street then Villain checks the turn giving you a range advantage. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In these two spots, your fold equity will be high enough to make betting profitable while checking with
            little to no SDV is worth close to 0EV</p>
        <p>There are also a few must bluff spots earlier on in the hand, but these are rarer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C-Betting the flop with a very big range advantage and no SDV</li>
            <li>Being out of position with a promising draw that has zero SDV</li>
            <li>Double barrelling a very good turn card for your range again with no SDV but some sort of nut
                potential</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other than that, most juicy looking bluff opportunities are optional in Game Theory, exploitative factors
            aside.</p>

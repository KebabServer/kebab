            <h3>Observations:</h3>
            <p>1. The quickest RFIs are likely to receive fewer folds to 3bets in comparison to the overall fold
                percentage.</p>
            <p>The reason is, if a player is multi-tabling and they pick up a premium hand with the chance to RFI,
                they will do so quickly in order to move to the next table and decision.</p>
            <p>2. Players who take a very long time to RFI are likely distracted with other tables and are unsure if
                they want to RFI at another when holding a marginal hand.</p>
            <p>This also ties in with our first theory, that a distracted player will instantly raise a strong hand.
                Therefore, these long RFI timings will result in a higher fold to 3bet percentage.</p>
            <p>3. Also 5Bet Frequency goes up when the player has 3bet quickly. (Source data from Meta Game private training tool.)</p>

            <p>1. The quickest 3Bets are likely to receive fewer folds to 4Bets in comparison to the overall fold

            <p>Players who take a long time to 3Bet are likely debating whether or not they should 3Bet a marginal hand.
                They are checking things like their opponent's fold to 3Bet%, other various HUD stats, and current game
                flow dynamics.</p>

        <h1>Range and Nut Advantage</h1>
        <h2>Range advantage</h2>
        <p>Having a significantly large range advantage can be achieved with a combination the following range vs.
            range attributes.</p>
        <p>Having more <b style="color:#20aa20">very high equity hands</b> as a concentration of your range than
            your opponent does of
            his/hers.
        </p>
        <p>Having more <b style="color:#0f550f">quite high equity hands</b> as a concentration of your range than
            your opponent does of
            his/hers.
        </p>
        <p>Having more <b style="color:#dd471afb">less very low equity hands</b> as a concentration of your range
            than your opponent does of his/hers.</p>
        <p>Thinking about entire ranges vs entire ranges can be confusing and there is nothing worse than an
            overwhelmed and cluttered mind at the tables.</p>
        <p>Before we install the right thought processes, let's uninstall the wrong ones.</p>

        <h2 class="fallacy">The Nut Obssession Fallacy</h2>
        <p>You will sometimes hear poker players to have a "<b style="color:#cef71b">Range Advantage</b>" and then
            proceed to justify it by listing their most nutted hands.</p>
        <p>We need to remember that low equity hands bring down the equity of our range just as much as high equity
            hands bring up the equity of our range.</p>
        <p>Just as having a lot of medium equity hands in you range will move your equity towards the middle.</p>
        <p>The whole range vs range picture is what is important for determining <b style="color:#cef71b">Range
                Advantage</b></p>
        <!--      <h2 class="example">Example</h2>
        <p>Range 1: AA:1 72o:12</p>
        <p>vs</p>
        <p>Range 2: JJ:1 TT:1 99:1 AQ:1</p>
        <p>Range 1 has Nut advantage, but range 2 has range advantage.</p> -->


        <h2 class="fallacy">The Total Amount Fallacy</h2>
        <p>The <b class="yellow">Total Amount Fallacy</b> occurs when we ignore how concentrated good hands
            are and just talk about how many absolute combos of them we have.
        </p>
        <!--      <h2 class="example">Example</h2>
        <p>Range 1: AA:4 73o:16</p>
        <p>vs</p>
        <p>Range 2: AA:1 73o:2</p>
        <p>Range 1 has more absolute combos of AA, but range 2 has higher portion of it. Range 2 is stronger.</p> -->
        <h2 class="fallacy">The Range Advantage Therefore Bet Fallacy</h2>
        <p>Having a <b class="yellow">large range advantage</b> makes our range want to bet
            more often on the flop, but generally speaking on the turn and river we must polarise
            our betting range to some extent.</p>
        <h2 class="example">Example 1</h2>
        <svg class="svg_hand" card-array="90,60,J,h,135,60,T,h,180,60,4,c,135,130,Q,d,310,15,8,d,355,15,8,s"
            betsize-array="10,60,X,245,85,X,10,130,X,245,140,B75" width="400" height="200">
            <text x="120" y="45" fill="yellow" font-size="16">2Bet Pot</text>
            <text x="10" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">BB</text>
            <text x="250" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">CO</text>
            <text x="233" y="195" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">Blunder!</text>
        </svg>
        <p>CO has total equity of 57.5% and thus big range advantage. Despite having a big range advantage we cannot bet
            this middling hand. It would be a <b class="yellow">polarisation error</b>.</p>


        <h2 class="fallacy">The Range Disadvantage Therefore Check Fallacy</h2>
        <p>Having a <b class="yellow">large range disadvantage</b> means we will usually check when out of position on
            the flop, but generally speaking on the turn and river we must polarise our betting range to some extent.
        </p>


        <h2 class="example">Example 2</h2>
        <svg class="svg_hand" card-array="90,60,J,h,135,60,T,h,180,60,4,c,135,130,T,s,310,15,4,h,355,15,4,s"
            betsize-array="10,60,X,245,85,B75,10,95,C,10,130,X,245,140,X" width="400" height="200">
            <text x="120" y="45" fill="yellow" font-size="16">2Bet Pot</text>
            <text x="10" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">BB</text>
            <text x="250" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">CO</text>
            <text x="233" y="195" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">Blunder!</text>
        </svg>
        <p>CO has total equity of 43.5% and thus range disadvantage. Despite having a range disadvantage we still have
            to bet. Urgency is too high with a hand that needs to build the pot.</p>
        <h2>Nut advantage</h2>
        <p>Having a significantly large nut advantage can be archieved by having very high equity (85%+) hands in your
            range at a higher concentration than your opponent has them in his range.</p>
        <h2 class="fallacy">The Literal Nuts Fallacy</h2>
        <p>Don't take "nuts" too literally. It's more powerful to have 24 combos of 90% equity hands than 3 combos of
            96% equity hands.</p>
        <h2 class="fallacy">Nutsaphobia</h2>
        <p>Just because villain has more nuts than you do or has the nuts a relevant amount of the time doesn't mean you
            can't still bet hands for the purposes we have discussed. Don't fear the worst every time just because it is
            not impossible.</p>
        <h2>Recognising Range Advantage</h2>
        <div class="container"><svg class="svg_hand" card-array="0,0,J,h,45,0,T,h,90,0,4,c" width="210" height="60">
            </svg>

            <p>On this flop, CO vs BB, the in position player has a sizable range advantage. PIO 2
                tells us that his range boasts total equity of 55.226.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This comes from three main sources:</p>
        <p>1.CO has <b class="yellow">unique hands</b> (ones his opponent cannot have) which are <b
                style="color:#20aa20">very high equity</b>. This is the part of range advantage which we can describe as
            <b class="yellow"> nut advantage</b>. It contributes to his <b class="yellow">range
                advantage</b> but is not identical to it. For example: KsKh with 80.16% equity.
        </p>
        <p>2. CO has more combinations as a percentage of his range of top pair and second pair. These combos will
            sometimes get 3-Bet by the player in the BB so he has them less often than CO does. These hands are <b
                style="color:#20aa20"> quite high equity</b> and strengthen a range of which they are a part. For
            example: QsJs with 73.43% equity.</p>
        <p>3. CO has less combinations as a percentage of his range of low suited cards like K-rag and Q-rag suited.
            These <b class="red"> very low equity hands</b> will be fairly abundant in BB's range. Such hands
            bring down the equity of the range containing them. For example: 7d5d with 13.98% equity.</p>
        <h2>Recognising Nut Advantage</h2>
        <p>A large <b class="yellow">nut advantage</b> exists when as a concentration of our range we have a
            lot more very high equity hands than our opponent. Remember, these do not have to be the absolute literal
            nuts.</p>
        <p>In this situation, the in-position player has a large <b class="yellow">nut advantage</b> despite
            having less combos of the literal nuts.</p>
        <h2 class="example">Example</h2>

        <svg class="svg_hand" card-array="90,60,9,d,135,60,3,d,180,60,2,s" betsize-array="10,60,X,245,85,?" width="300"
            height="150">
            <text x="120" y="45" fill="yellow" font-size="16">2Bet Pot</text>
            <text x="10" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">BB</text>
            <text x="250" y="50" fill="#ffffff" font-size="20">UTG</text>
        </svg>
        <p>Here UTG cannot have 33 or 22 and BU can and both players can have 99 at full frequency. But sets are an
            irrelevant part of ranges. BB's range here spans 202 combos and 22/33 are only 6 of them (3%)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile UTG's range spans 224 combos and JJ-AA which are hands he has much more often than BB are 24 of
            them (11%) These hands have around 80% equity and are entitled to more than the pot in EV. Thus UTG has a
            sizable nut advantage. </p>
        <p>We can use PIO's <b class="yellow">range explorer</b> tool to explore wheter one player has large
            nut advantage.</p>
        <img src="Images/article_Cbetting_rangeexplorer.png">
        <h2>Range Advantage and Flop Betting Frequency</h2>
        <p>Whenever we have a <b class="yellow">large range advantage</b> on the flop, we want to start betting more of
            our range. This means that we will be betting a <b class="yellow">less polarised</b> range in spots where
            our range has a lot more equity then villain's does.</p>
        <p>Remember our three purposes of betting? Value, Denial and Bluff.</p>
        <p><b class="red">Bluffing</b> and <b class="yellow">Denial</b> both benefit from Villain's range being weaker
            because Villain has to fold more frequently when he lacks the strength to continue the expected mathematical
            amount of the time.</p>
        <h3>Value</h3>
        <p>There are more hands we can value bet when Villain's range is weak. Weaker absolute hand strength holdings
            become stronger holdings now and we get to value bet more thinly.</p>
        <h3>Bluffing</h3>
        <p>Since fold equity is higher than normal when we have a range advantage our bluffs are more profitable so we
            want to make more of them.</p>
        <h3>Denial</h3>
        <p>Since Villain's range is relatively weak, a lot of his combos will be air hands that have some live re-draw.
            We will benefit more now from the bonus of denial since we will run into live weak hands that fold quite
            frequently.</p>
        <h2>Nut advantage and Flop sizing</h2>
        <p>Recall that the higher equity our value betting candidate the bigger the sizing it can consider using and the
            higher the investment ceiling for that hand across all streets.</p>
        <p>When we have a large nut advantage we have more hands in very high equity regions, therefore our range will
            want to build a large pot more often. Accelerating pot growth immediately on the flop is one way of catering
            to these hands.</p>
        <h2 class="theorem">Big or Small Strategy</h2>
        <p>When we have a <b class="yellow">large nut advantage</b> we shall adopt <svg class="svg_hand"
                betsize-array="0,0,B75" width="50" height="20"></svg> as our only flop sizing.
        </p>
        <p>When we <b class="yellow">do not</b> have a <b class="yellow">large nut advantage</b> we shall adopt
            <svg class="svg_hand" betsize-array="0,0,B33" width="50" height="20"></svg> as our only flop sizing.
        </p>
        <p>Note that we are NOT asking <b class="red">"Who has the nut advantage?"</b>, because a small nut advantage
            isn't enough to make
            us size up on the flop.</p>
        <p>We are asking: <b class="green">"Do we have a large nut advantage?"</b>, because that is sufficient for
            sizing up on the flop.</p>
        <h2>Small R.A / Small N.A</h2>
        <p>When we have only a small range advantage and small nut advantage. Our range will bet infrequently (more
            polarised) and use <svg class="svg_hand" betsize-array="0,0,B33" width="50" height="20"></svg>.</p>
        <h2 class="example">Example</h2>
        <svg class="svg_hand" card-array="90,60,T,s,135,60,8,s,180,60,5,s" betsize-array="10,60,?" width="300"

        <h2 class="fallacy">The Frequency Controls Sizing Fallacy</h2>
        <p>You might hear people say something like: <text class="red">"Shouldn't we be betting bigger if we are only
                betting rarely?"</text></p>
        <p>But this mistakes <b class="yellow">correlation for cause.</b> We very often have the combination of nut
            advantage but no range advantage when we are barrelling turns etc. but this is not always true on the flop.
        </p>
        <h2>Small R.A / Big N.A</h2>
        <p>When we have only a small range advantage and big nut advantage. Our range will bet infrequently (more
            polarised) and can use bigger size <svg class="svg_hand" betsize-array="0,0,B75" width="50"
                height="20"></svg>.</p>
        <h2 class="example">Example</h2>

        <p>BU has a large nut advantage here, allowing him to adopt B75 as his sizing of choise.</p>
        <p>BB has equalised on this flop in terms of range advantage since the texture connects with a lot of his unique
            hands.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile some of BU's unique hands such as two big cards, have dropped significantly in equity on this
            texture.</p>

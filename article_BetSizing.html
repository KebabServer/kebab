        <h1>Bet Sizing</h1>
        <h2>Clarke's Theorem</h2>
        <p>The <em class="yellow">more polarised</em> Villain's range is compared to yours, the <em
                class="yellow">smaller your bet-sizing</em> should be and the <em class="yellow">less often</em> you
            should <em class="yellow">raise</em>.</p>
        <p>The <em class="yellow">more condensed</em> Villain's range is compared to yours, the <em
                class="yellow">larger your bet-sizing</em> should be and the <em class="yellow">more often</em> you
            should <em class="yellow">raise</em>.</p>
        <h2>Toolkit</h2>
        <p><em class="yellow">Toolkit</em> is an exhaustive set of the bet-sizes we will consider in a certain spot.</p>
        <h2>Simplifying Turn Sizing</h2>
        <p>On the Turn it is sensible to limit your bet-sizing options to either one or two in order to make the game
            tree more manageable.</p>
        <p>In position we will always be simplifying to just one bet size which will either be B75 or B150.</p>
        <p>The idea is that since checking is so profitable in position (sinze we have guaranteed equity realisation for
            at least one street) it is usually not necessary to reopen the action for a smaller bet.</p>
        <p>Out of position we will generally want to have a B33 and either B75 or a B150.</p>
        <p>Which of the larger sizes we choose to include in our strategy will depend on Clarke's Theorem and the extent
            of our nut advantage.</p>
        <p>Because checking has lower EV out of position than it does in position, the smaller bet can often be a
            necessary action.</p>
        <h2>B0 (Check)</h2>
        <p>This option is nearly always included on the turn apart for some extremely favourable and rare we continue to
            range bet.</p>
        <p>One such spot is: SB vs BU 3BP - Turn C-Bet on: <svg class="svg_hand" card-array="3,3,8,s,48,3,8,d,93,3,4,c,155,3,K,h" width="200"
